      <h2>WEB</h2>
      The World Wide Web (WWW, W3) is a global information space where people can share information through computers connected to the Internet . Often referred to simply as the Web . The term is often used synonymously with the Internet, but is strictly different. The web is just one service that runs on the Internet, like e-mail . Since 1993, however, the web has been the absolute location of the Internet structure.
      In the Internet , it is a transmission method that exchanges pictures and characters using HTTP protocol , hypertext , and HTML format.
